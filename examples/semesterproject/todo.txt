Bugs:

Features:
Add drag & drop
change navigation from double click to something else for mobile
find a way to simplify drawTree
get rid of the JSON area, replace with download button - Might need to use Ajax calls for this to work, so we will need either php or a webframe to do this. I think js can't really do this (easily) due to security problems that can come up.
center interface in window
Date picker -- http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/calendar/ (List of possible libs to use)

Architecture:
migrate to Apache - Apache or Apache2 or Lighttpd?
migrate to mySQL - which is better for this mySQL or postgresql?
migrate from pure html w/js to a web-frame w/js (like bootstrap or something) it
could solve the mobile compatibility and help with making things look "pretty"
