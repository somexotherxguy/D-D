the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Druid table.
Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When
you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can also change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at
least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and
attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.")

magically assume the shape of a beast that you have
seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Your druid level determines the beasts you can
transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At
2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast
that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t
have a flying or swimming speed.
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours
equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then
revert to your normal form unless you expend another
use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to
0 hit points, or die.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies,
in addition to gaining those of the creature. If
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
• When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to your normal form. For example, if you
take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form
to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to the
capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t
break your concentration on a spell you’ve already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve
already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the new
form is physically capable of doing so. However, you
can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision,
unless your new form also has that sense.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or
is w orn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new
form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s
shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change
size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear
must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges with the form has no
effect until you leave the form.")

("Wizard", 1, "Spellcasting", "As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook
containing spells that show the first glimmerings of
your true power.
Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice
from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level
wizard spells of your choice.
Preparing and Casting Spells
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available
for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination,
chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from
your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and
memorizing the incantations and gestures you must
make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level
for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
study and memorization. You use your Intelligence
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your intelligence modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.
You don't need to have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two
wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each
of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add
to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).")
